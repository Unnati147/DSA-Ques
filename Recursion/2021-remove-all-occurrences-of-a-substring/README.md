<ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

You are given two strings, s and part.
Your task is to repeatedly find the leftmost occurrence of the substring part in s and remove it, until part no longer exists in s.

Finally, return the modified string.

âœ¨ Examples
Example 1

Input:

s = "daabcbaabcbc"
part = "abc"


Output:

"dab"


Explanation:

da[abc]baabcbc â†’ remove abc â†’ dabaabcbc

daba[abc]bc â†’ remove abc â†’ dababc

dab[abc] â†’ remove abc â†’ dab

Example 2

Input:

s = "axxxxyyyyb"
part = "xy"


Output:

"ab"


Explanation:

axxx[xy]yyyb â†’ axxxyyyb

axx[xy]yyb â†’ axxyyb

ax[xy]yb â†’ axyb

a[xy]b â†’ ab

âœ… Constraints

1 <= s.length <= 1000

1 <= part.length <= 1000

s and part consist only of lowercase English letters.

ðŸ§  Approach

Repeated Search

Continuously check if part exists inside s.

If found, remove it by slicing the string.

Termination

Stop when s.find(part) returns -1 (means no occurrence left).

Efficiency

Each removal takes O(n) time (since slicing makes a new string).
